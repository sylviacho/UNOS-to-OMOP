# UNOS-to-OMOP

A repository for mappings between concepts in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) standard concepts. 

This project is the first step towards enabling the augmention of the UNOS data with other data sources such as the EHR which would provide additional data to substantiate transplant outcomes analysis. The challenge of augmenting UNOS registry data with other data sources is in the different data structures and coding systems. A solution to this problem could be to transform the disparate data sources into a common data model (CDM) format which involves the process of standardizing the schema and terminology. We chose to standardize the UNOS coding schema to the OMOP standard concepts which is one of the widely accepted CDMs for national initiatives.
